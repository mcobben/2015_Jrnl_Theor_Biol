All the data files are .mat files, to be opened using matlab.
They all have the same structure.

The D0-D10 parameter values are 4-D double.
They show for:
5 different landscapes in
2 replicate runs
the total number of individuals with
genetic dispersal value 0-10
for 12 time steps
across 40 5-kilometer blocks

The D0_av - D10_av parameters are 12x40 double.
They are the averages over the 5x2 (landscapes times replicate) runs of the D0-D10 parameters.
D0_av - D10_av then signify the average number of individuals with the respective (D0-D10) genetic dispersal value
in time (12 steps) and space (40 range blocks).
